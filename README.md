# 10Weeks

This repository is a pet project of mine dealing with dichotomous classification cases.  While it is all fine and well to complete a number of classes dealing with modeling, nothing works better than repeating the process over and over again using different datasets to sharpen your skills.  I have put this repository together to facilitate that process.  

The challenge is to model all of the dataset within a given period, e.g. 10 datasets in 10 days, weeks, months or years.  If you choose days you probably have too much free time on your hands; if you choose weeks you have a day job and modeling is a passion; if you choose months you probably have a job, kids and not enough time to spare; if you choose years, well your just a slacker (just like me).  

Good Luck and feel free to submit your take on the project.  I would welcome scripts, markdown files or just plain old graphs.
